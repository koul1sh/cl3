Your code is a basic **Artificial Immune System (AIS) classifier** that uses a clonal selection-inspired approach to classify structural data as **healthy** or **damaged** based on a few numerical features (like vibration, strain, and displacement).

### ‚úÖ What the code does:

1. **Training phase**:

   * Stores training data as "antibodies" in memory (`self.memory_cells`), each associated with a class label (0 or 1).

2. **Classification phase**:

   * For each test sample (called an **antigen**):

     * Clones every antibody `num_clones` times.
     * Each clone is **mutated** slightly (random Gaussian noise).
     * **Affinity** (i.e., similarity) is computed as the **negative Euclidean distance** between the test sample and the clone.
     * The **clone with highest affinity** is selected, and its label is used for classification.

### üß† Intuition:

* If a test sample is very similar to a stored "healthy" pattern, mutated clones of that antibody will closely match the test sample.
* The clone with the best match (lowest distance) determines the predicted class.

### ‚úÖ Output (for your test samples):

You should get something like:

```
=== Classification Results ===
Test Sample 1: Healthy
Test Sample 2: Damaged
```

Which makes sense, since:

* `[0.12, 0.19, 0.14]` is close to healthy training samples.
* `[0.51, 0.59, 0.54]` is close to damaged training samples.

Would you like help improving this classifier's accuracy or generalization, e.g., using affinity thresholds, more robust mutation strategies, or hybrid approaches?


Sure! You're working with an **Artificial Immune System (AIS)** classifier based on the **Clonal Selection Theory**, which is a concept inspired by how the biological immune system works. Let‚Äôs break this down clearly.

## üß¨ What is Clonal Selection?

Clonal Selection is a biological theory that explains how the body‚Äôs immune system defends against pathogens:

1. When an antigen (a foreign substance) enters the body, specific immune cells (B-cells) recognize it.
2. The most reactive B-cells are **cloned**.
3. These clones **mutate** slightly (called somatic hypermutation) to improve their ability to bind the antigen.
4. The best-fitting clones become memory cells or attack the antigen.

## ü§ñ What is Clonal Selection in Artificial Immune Systems (AIS)?

In AIS, the Clonal Selection principle is applied for solving pattern recognition and classification problems. It works as follows:

### 1. **Antibodies = Training Patterns**

* Each antibody is a vector (like a row of features).
* It's labeled (e.g., `0` for healthy, `1` for damaged).

### 2. **Antigen = New Input / Test Data**

* This is the unknown data you want to classify (e.g., new structural data).

### 3. **Affinity**

* Measures how close an antibody (or clone) is to the antigen.
* In your code: `affinity = -Euclidean distance`.

### 4. **Cloning & Mutation**

* Antibodies are cloned multiple times.
* Each clone is mutated a little to explore the space near the antibody.
* This mimics the immune system's way of producing variations.

### 5. **Selection**

* All clones are tested for their affinity to the test sample.
* The clone with the **highest affinity** (smallest distance) is selected.
* The label of this clone is used to classify the test sample.

## üõ†Ô∏è Your Code in Summary

### Training:

```python
self.memory_cells.append(Antibody(data[i], labels[i]))
```

Stores labeled examples as antibodies.

### Classification:

1. Clone each antibody `num_clones` times.
2. Slightly mutate the clones.
3. Calculate affinity between each clone and the test sample.
4. Choose the best-matching clone.
5. Return its label as the prediction.

## ‚úÖ Advantages of Clonal Selection-Based AIS

* Doesn't require gradient descent or backpropagation.
* Good for small datasets.
* Naturally balances exploration (mutation) and exploitation (selection).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* May not scale well to high-dimensional or large datasets.
* Needs careful tuning of mutation rate and number of clones.
* Sensitive to noise if not regularized or enhanced.
