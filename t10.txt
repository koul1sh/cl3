This script tackles a tiny instance of the **Traveling Salesman Problem** (TSP) using an **Ant Colony Optimization** (ACO) metaheuristic, modeling how real ants find shortest paths by laying and following pheromone trails. At the start, it defines the pairwise distances among four “cities” and converts them into a **visibility** heuristic (the inverse of distance) so shorter links look more attractive. A square matrix of **pheromone levels** is initialized uniformly, representing the “chemical trail” that will guide the ants’ choices.

Over a fixed number of iterations, a pool of virtual “ants” each builds a complete tour by starting from a random city and repeatedly choosing its next city based on a probability weighted by the current pheromone intensity (raised to a pheromone exponent) and the visibility (raised to a heuristic exponent). Once every ant has returned to its starting point—completing a round trip—the code computes each route’s total length. It then updates the pheromone matrix by first **evaporating** a fraction of the old pheromone (to prevent premature convergence) and then **depositing** new pheromone along each edge proportional to the inverse of that ant’s tour length (so shorter routes get more reinforcement). Meanwhile, it keeps track of the best route seen so far and its distance.

By balancing **exploitation** (following strong pheromone trails) with **exploration** (pheromone evaporation and the probabilistic choice rule), ACO is able to discover high‑quality solutions to combinatorial challenges like TSP without exhaustively enumerating every possible tour. When you run this code, it will print the best route found among all ant tours and its total distance, illustrating how the collective, iterative behavior of simple agents can efficiently approximate an optimal path in a complex search space.


Thought for a couple of seconds


Imagine our four cities are named A, B, C, and D, with the following distances (in a matrix form, but think of it like a road map):

```
    A   B   C   D
A [ ∞, 10, 15, 20 ]
B [10,  ∞, 35, 25 ]
C [15, 35,  ∞, 30 ]
D [20, 25, 30,  ∞ ]
```

We convert those distances into a **visibility** score, which is simply 1/distance (so a shorter road is “more visible” to an ant). Every pair of cities also starts with the same small amount of “pheromone” on it.

### 1. An ant builds a tour

* Suppose Ant 1 starts at city A.
* To choose its next stop, it looks at the unvisited cities B, C, and D.

  * Visibility to B is 1/10 = 0.1
  * Visibility to C is 1/15 ≈ 0.067
  * Visibility to D is 1/20 = 0.05
* Since the pheromone levels are all equal at first, the probability of going to each city is proportional to these visibility values. B is the most attractive, C next, and D the least. The ant rolls a random number (weighted by those three values) to pick its next city.
* Say it picks B, so now the partial route is A→B.

It repeats the same procedure from B (this time choosing among C and D), then from whichever city it lands on next, until it has visited all four cities. Finally, it returns from its last stop back to A to close the loop—e.g., it might end up with the route

```
A → B → D → C → A
```

### 2. Measuring and updating pheromone

* We compute the total length of that tour by summing each leg’s distance. For our example route:

  * A→B is 10
  * B→D is 25
  * D→C is 30
  * C→A is 15
  * **Total = 10 + 25 + 30 + 15 = 80**
* The ant then “deposits” pheromone along each edge it traveled in inverse proportion to its tour length (so here, 1/80 ≈ 0.0125 per edge).
* Meanwhile, the algorithm **evaporates** a fraction of the existing pheromone everywhere (for instance, cutting all pheromone levels in half if the evaporation rate is 0.5). This evaporation prevents the system from getting stuck following only one path.

---

### 3. Iterating and finding the best route

* Next iteration, all ants again build tours—but now, the edges that belonged to shorter tours (like maybe A→C→B→D→A if that one was only length 65) have slightly more pheromone, making those edges more attractive to subsequent ants.
* Over many iterations (say, 50 in the code), the colony collectively reinforces the shortest loops and gradually weeds out the long ones.
* The algorithm keeps track of the **best route seen so far**. If, for example, at iteration 12 an ant discovered the route

```
A → C → B → D → A
```

with total length 65, that becomes the current champion. Even if later no ant beats it, it’s saved and finally reported.

---

### Why this works

* **Exploitation**: Ants prefer edges with more pheromone, so good routes get reinforced.
* **Exploration**: Randomness in choosing next city and pheromone evaporation let ants still try less‑traveled roads, avoiding local traps.
* **Emergence**: No single ant knows the best route, but collectively, by depositing and following pheromone, they home in on an optimal or near‑optimal solution.

So with our tiny four‑city example, you’ll see the script print out something like:

```
Best route: ['A', 'C', 'B', 'D', 'A']
Shortest distance: 65.00
```

showing how these simple rules mimic ant foraging to solve a hard combinatorial puzzle.
