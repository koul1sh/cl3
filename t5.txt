This code implements a **Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA)** — a nature-inspired optimization technique modeled after how the human immune system responds to antigens. The goal here is to **maximize** a non-linear function:
  **f(x) = x × sin(10πx) + 1**,
within a domain of **x ∈ \[-1, 2]**. This function has many peaks and valleys, making it a good candidate for evolutionary algorithms like CSA.

### Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Objective Function**:
   The function being optimized is oscillatory and non-convex, meaning it has many local maxima. The algorithm seeks the **global maximum** over 100 generations.

2. **Initial Population**:
   The algorithm starts with a random population of 20 candidate solutions (`POP_SIZE = 20`) spread within the domain. Each value represents a potential solution (like an "antibody" in immune terms).

3. **Fitness Evaluation**:
   The quality of each candidate (its "fitness") is measured using the objective function.

4. **Selection**:
   The top half of the population (those with higher fitness values) are selected for cloning.

5. **Cloning and Mutation**:
   Each selected candidate is cloned 5 times (`CLONE_RATE = 5`). The clones are then mutated — slight random changes are added to explore nearby solutions. The mutation is adaptive: better candidates mutate less, while worse ones mutate more, to promote exploration.

6. **Replacement**:
   After evaluating all the clones, the algorithm keeps the top 20 (same size as the original population). Then, to maintain diversity and avoid premature convergence, 2 random new individuals are added to replace the worst ones.

7. **Best Solution Tracking**:
   Throughout the generations, the best solution found so far is recorded and returned at the end.

### Summary:

This code effectively demonstrates a biologically-inspired optimization method that balances **exploitation** (cloning and refining the best solutions) and **exploration** (mutating clones and introducing randomness). It's a clever way to solve problems with many local optima, where traditional gradient-based methods would get stuck.

**Clonal Selection** is a principle from immunology that has been adapted into a computational algorithm for solving optimization and learning problems. It is inspired by how the human immune system detects and combats pathogens using antibodies.

### In biology:

When a pathogen (like a virus) enters the body, the immune system responds by:

* Selecting **antibodies** that best match the pathogen (antigen).
* These selected antibodies are **cloned** (copied) in large numbers.
* During cloning, **mutations** occur, producing slightly varied antibodies.
* Some of these mutated antibodies may bind even better to the pathogen.
* The best ones are preserved and remembered by the immune system for faster future response.

### In computing (Clonal Selection Algorithm - CSA):

This idea is used to solve optimization problems:

1. **Antibodies** = potential solutions to the problem.
2. **Antigens** = the problem to be solved or the fitness function.
3. **Selection** = choosing the best current solutions (high fitness).
4. **Cloning** = replicating these solutions.
5. **Mutation** = introducing small changes to clones to explore nearby solutions.
6. **Replacement** = replacing weaker solutions to keep the population improving.

### Why it works:

* **Exploitation**: Good solutions are cloned and fine-tuned.
* **Exploration**: Mutations help escape local optima by testing new possibilities.
* **Diversity**: Adding new random solutions prevents the algorithm from getting stuck.

### Applications:

* Function optimization (like in your code),
* Machine learning (e.g., classification problems),
* Pattern recognition,
* Scheduling and resource allocation.

It’s a powerful metaheuristic for problems where the solution space is complex and traditional methods struggle. Would you like to see a visual analogy between immune response and algorithm flow?
